## 📚 List of Programs

### 🔢 Basics & Math
- **factorial_iterative_and_recursive** – Calculate factorial using both recursive and iterative approaches.
- **decimal_to_binary_stack** – Convert a decimal number to binary using a stack (array implementation).

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- **binary_search_iterative_recursive** – Perform binary search using both iterative and recursive methods.

### 🧹 Sorting & Merging
- **bubble_sort_merge_arrays** – Sort two arrays using Bubble Sort and merge them into a single sorted array.

### 🧠 Data Structures
- **remove_duplicates_array** – Remove duplicate elements from an array without using extra space.

### 🧮 Matrices
- **matrix_multiplication_trace_menu** – Menu-driven program to multiply two matrices and calculate the trace of a square matrix.
- **matrix_transpose_symmetric_orthogonal** – Menu-driven program to:
  - Find transpose
  - Check if the matrix is symmetric
  - Check if the matrix is orthogonal

### 🔺 Patterns
- **pascals_triangle** – Generate Pascal's Triangle using a 2D array.
